# MVC_Security_Authorisation
For the lack of code online that describe this, I have gotten a book and done as per the 3 chapter tutorials and shared it

The book :
##Pro ASP.Net MVC 5 Platform by Adam Freeman
* Chapter 13
* Chapter 14
* Chapter 15  [Excludes 3rd Party Authentication]

##Notes
Claiming no credit for this since this is just a repo to check in code I learn from the book; and to share the knowledge ;

However aiming to do a claims - role group authorization method so might add on later
Everything will be available under different tags to prevent contamination of code
